\title{Terminate one or more cluster nodes using process signaling}
\usage{
killNode(x, signal = tools::SIGTERM, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{cluster or cluster node to terminate.}

\item{signal}{An integer that specifies the signal level to be sent
to the parallel R process.
It's only \code{tools::SIGINT} (2) and \code{tools::SIGTERM} (15) that are
supported on Unix, macOS, and MS Windows.  All other signals are
platform specific.}

\item{\ldots}{Not used.}
}
\value{
TRUE if the signal was successfully applied, FALSE if not, and NA if
signaling is not supported on the specific cluster or node.
}
\description{
Terminate one or more cluster nodes using process signaling
}
\details{
Note that the preferred way to terminate a cluster is via
\code{\link[parallel:makeCluster]{parallel::stopCluster()}}, because it terminates the cluster nodes
by kindly asking each of them to nicely shut themselves down.
Using \code{killNode()} is a much more sever approach. It abruptly
terminates the underlying R process, possibly without giving the
parallel worker a chance to terminate gracefully.  For example,
it might get terminated in the middle of writing to file.

\code{\link[tools:pskill]{tools::pskill()}} is used to send the signal to the R process hosting
the parallel worker.
}
\section{Known limitations}{

Currently, it's only possible to send signals to parallel workers, that
is, cluster nodes, that run on the local machine.
If attempted to use \code{killNode()} on a remote parallel workers, \code{NA}
is returned and an informative warning is produced.

\examples{
cl <- makeClusterPSOCK(2)
print(isNodeAlive(cl))  ## [1] TRUE TRUE

res <- killNode(cl)
print(res)

## It might take a moment before the background
## workers are shutdown after having been signaled
Sys.sleep(2)

print(isNodeAlive(cl))  ## [1] FALSE FALSE

}
\seealso{
Use \code{\link[=isNodeAlive]{isNodeAlive()}} to check whether one or mode cluster nodes are alive.
