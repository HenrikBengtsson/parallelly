# Get the Recent CPU Load

Get the Recent CPU Load

## Usage

``` r
cpuLoad()
```

## Value

A named numeric vector with three elements `1min`, `5min`, and `15min`
with non-negative values. These values represent estimates of the CPU
load during the last minute, the last five minutes, and the last fifteen
minutes \[1\]. An idle system have values close to zero, and a heavily
loaded system have values near
[`parallel::detectCores()`](https://rdrr.io/r/parallel/detectCores.html).
If they are unknown, missing values are returned.

## Details

This function works only Unix-like system with `/proc/loadavg`.
