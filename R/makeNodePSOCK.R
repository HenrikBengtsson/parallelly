#' @param worker The hostname or IP number of the machine where the worker
#' should run.
#' Attribute `localhost` can be set to TRUE or FALSE to manually indicate
#' whether `worker` is the same as the local host.
#' 
#' @param master The hostname or IP number of the master / calling machine, as
#' known to the workers.  If NULL (default), then the default is
#' `Sys.info()[["nodename"]]` unless `worker` is _localhost_ or
#' `revtunnel = TRUE` in case it is `"localhost"`.
#' 
#' @param connectTimeout The maximum time (in seconds) allowed for each socket
#' connection between the master and a worker to be established (defaults to
#' 2 minutes). _See note below on current lack of support on Linux and
#' macOS systems._
#' 
#' @param timeout The maximum time (in seconds) allowed to pass without the
#' master and a worker communicate with each other (defaults to 30 days).
#' 
#' @param rscript,homogeneous The system command for launching \command{Rscript}
#' on the worker and whether it is installed in the same path as the calling
#' machine or not.  For more details, see below.
#' 
#' @param rscript_args Additional arguments to \command{Rscript} (as a character
#' vector).  This argument can be used to customize the \R environment of the
#' workers before they launches.
#' For instance, use `rscript_args = c("-e", shQuote('setwd("/path/to")'))`
#' to set the working directory to \file{/path/to} on _all_ workers.
#'
#' @param rscript_envs A named character vector environment variables to
#' set or unset on worker at startup, e.g.
#' `rscript_envs = c(FOO = "3.14", "HOME", "UNKNOWN", UNSETME = NA_character_)`.
#' If an element is not named, then the value of that variable will be used as
#' the name and the value will be the value of `Sys.getenv()` for that
#' variable.  Non-existing environment variables will be dropped.
#' These variables are set using `Sys.setenv()`.
#' An named element with value `NA_character_` will cause that variable to be
#' unset, which is done via `Sys.unsetenv()`.
#' 
#' @param rscript_libs A character vector of \R library paths that will be
#' used for the library search path of the \R workers.  An asterisk
#' (`"*"`) will be resolved to the default `.libPaths()` _on the
#' worker_. That is, to `prepend` a folder, instead of replacing the
#' existing ones, use `rscript_libs = c("new_folder", "*")`.
#' To pass down a non-default library path currently set _on the main \R
#' session_ to the workers, use `rscript_libs = .libPaths()`.
#' 
#' @param rscript_startup An \R expression or a character vector of \R code,
#' or a list with a mix of these, that will be evaluated on the \R worker
#' prior to launching the worker's event loop.
#' For instance, use `rscript_startup = 'setwd("/path/to")'`
#' to set the working directory to \file{/path/to} on _all_ workers.
#' 
#' @param rscript_sh The type of shell used where `rscript` is launched,
#' which should be `"sh"` is launched via a POSIX shell and `"cmd"` if 
#' launched via an MS Windows shell.  This controls how shell command-line
#' options are quoted, via
#' \code{\link[base:shQuote]{shQuote(..., type = rscript_sh)}}.
#' If `"auto"` (default), and the cluster node is launched locally, then it
#' is set to `"sh"` or `"cmd"` according to the current platform.
#' _If launched remotely_, then it is set to `"sh"` based on the assumption
#' remote machines typically launch commands via SSH in a POSIX shell.
#' If the remote machines run MS Windows, use `rscript_sh = "cmd"`.
#'
#' @param default_packages A character vector or NULL that controls which R
#' packages are attached on each cluster node during startup.  An asterisk
#' (`"*"`) resolves to `getOption("defaultPackages")` _on the current machine_.
#' If NULL, then the default set of packages R are attached.
#'
#' @param methods If TRUE (default), then the \pkg{methods} package is also 
#' loaded. This is argument exists for legacy reasons due to how 
#' \command{Rscript} worked in R (< 3.5.0).
#' 
#' @param useXDR If FALSE (default), the communication between master and workers, which is binary, will use small-endian (faster), otherwise big-endian ("XDR"; slower).
#' 
#' @param socketOptions A character string that sets \R option 
#' \code{socketOptions} on the worker.
#' 
#' @param outfile Where to direct the \link[base:showConnections]{stdout} and
#' \link[base:showConnections]{stderr} connection output from the workers.
#' If NULL, then no redirection of output is done, which means that the
#' output is relayed in the terminal on the local computer.  On Windows, the
#' output is only relayed when running \R from a terminal but not from a GUI.
#' 
#' @param renice A numerical 'niceness' (priority) to set for the worker
#' processes.
#' 
#' @param rank A unique one-based index for each worker (automatically set).
#' 
#' @param rshcmd,rshopts The command (character vector) to be run on the master
#' to launch a process on another host and any additional arguments (character
#' vector).  These arguments are only applied if `machine` is not
#' _localhost_.  For more details, see below.
#' 
#' @param rshlogfile (optional) If a filename, the output produced by the
#' `rshcmd` call is logged to this file, of if TRUE, then it is logged
#' to a temporary file.  The log file name is available as an attribute
#' as part of the return node object.
#' _Warning: This only works with SSH clients that support command-line
#' option \option{-E out.log`}_.  For example, PuTTY's \command{plink} does
#' _not_ support this option, and any attempts to specify `rshlogfile` will
#' cause the SSH connection to fail.
#'
#' @param user (optional) The user name to be used when communicating with
#' another host.
#' 
#' @param revtunnel If TRUE, a reverse SSH tunnel is set up for each worker such
#' that the worker \R process sets up a socket connection to its local port
#' `(port - rank + 1)` which then reaches the master on port `port`.
#' If FALSE, then the worker will try to connect directly to port `port` on
#' `master`.
#' If NA, then TRUE or FALSE is inferred from inspection of `rshcmd[1]`.
#' For more details, see below.
#' 
#' @param manual If TRUE the workers will need to be run manually. The command
#' to run will be displayed.
#' 
#' @param dryrun If TRUE, nothing is set up, but a message suggesting how to
#' launch the worker from the terminal is outputted.  This is useful for
#' troubleshooting.
#'
#' @param quiet If TRUE, then no output will be produced other than that from
#' using `verbose = TRUE`.
#'
#' @param setup_strategy If `"parallel"` (default), the workers are set up
#' concurrently, one after the other.  If `"sequential"`, they are set up
#' sequentially.
#'
#' @param action This is an internal argument.
#'
#' @return `makeNodePSOCK()` returns a `"SOCKnode"` or
#' `"SOCK0node"` object representing an established connection to a worker.
#'
#' @section Definition of _localhost_:
#' A hostname is considered to be _localhost_ if it equals:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `"localhost"`,
#'   \item `"127.0.0.1"`, or
#'   \item `Sys.info()[["nodename"]]`.
#' }
#' It is also considered _localhost_ if it appears on the same line
#' as the value of `Sys.info()[["nodename"]]` in file \file{/etc/hosts}.
#' 
#' @section Default SSH client and options (arguments `rshcmd` and `rshopts`):
#' Arguments `rshcmd` and `rshopts` are only used when connecting
#' to an external host.
#' 
#' The default method for connecting to an external host is via SSH and the
#' system executable for this is given by argument `rshcmd`.  The default
#' is given by option
#' \code{\link[=parallelly.options]{parallelly.makeNodePSOCK.rshcmd}}.
#' If that is not
#' set, then the default is to use \command{ssh} on Unix-like systems,
#' including macOS as well as Windows 10.  On older MS Windows versions, which
#' does not have a built-in \command{ssh} client, the default is to use
#' (i) \command{plink} from the \href{https://www.putty.org/}{\command{PuTTY}}
#' project, and then (ii) the \command{ssh} client that is distributed with
#' RStudio.
#'
#' PuTTY puts itself on Windows' system \env{PATH} when installed, meaning this
#' function will find PuTTY automatically if installed.  If not, to manually
#' set specify PuTTY as the SSH client, specify the absolute pathname of
#' \file{plink.exe} in the first element and option \command{-ssh} in the
#' second as in `rshcmd = c("C:/Path/PuTTY/plink.exe", "-ssh")`.
#' This is because all elements of `rshcmd` are individually "shell"
#' quoted and element `rshcmd[1]` must be on the system \env{PATH}.
#'
#' Furthermore, when running \R from RStudio on Windows, the \command{ssh}
#' client that is distributed with RStudio will also be considered.
#' This client, which is from \href{https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/}{MinGW}
#' MSYS, is searched for in the folder given by the \env{RSTUDIO_MSYS_SSH}
#' environment variable---a variable that is (only) set when running RStudio.
#' To use this SSH client outside of RStudio, set \env{RSTUDIO_MSYS_SSH}
#' accordingly.
#'
#' You can override the default set of SSH clients that are searched for
#' by specifying them in argument `rshcmd` or via option
#' \code{\link[=parallelly.options]{parallelly.makeNodePSOCK.rshcmd}}
#' using the format `<...>`, e.g.
#' `rshcmd = c("<rstudio-ssh>", "<putty-plink>", "<ssh>")`.  See
#' below for examples.
#'
#' If no SSH-client is found, an informative error message is produced.
#'
#' Additional SSH command-line options may be specified via argument `rshopts`,
#' which defaults to option \code{parallelly.makeNodePSOCK.rshopts}. For
#' instance, a private SSH key can be provided as
#' `rshopts = c("-i", "~/.ssh/my_private_key")`.  PuTTY users should
#' specify a PuTTY PPK file, e.g.
#' `rshopts = c("-i", "C:/Users/joe/.ssh/my_keys.ppk")`.
#' Contrary to `rshcmd`, elements of `rshopts` are not quoted.
#' 
#' @section Accessing external machines that prompts for a password:
#' _IMPORTANT: With one exception, it is not possible to for these
#' functions to log in and launch \R workers on external machines that requires
#' a password to be entered manually for authentication._
#' The only known exception is the PuTTY client on Windows for which one can
#' pass the password via command-line option \option{-pw}, e.g. 
#' `rshopts = c("-pw", "MySecretPassword")`.
#'
#' Note, depending on whether you run \R in a terminal or via a GUI, you might
#' not even see the password prompt.  It is also likely that you cannot enter
#' a password, because the connection is set up via a background system call.
#'
#' The poor man's workaround for setup that requires a password is to manually
#' log into the each of the external machines and launch the \R workers by hand.
#' For this approach, use `manual = TRUE` and follow the instructions
#' which include cut'n'pasteable commands on how to launch the worker from the
#' external machine.
#'
#' However, a much more convenient and less tedious method is to set up
#' key-based SSH authentication between your local machine and the external
#' machine(s), as explain below.
#'
#' @section Accessing external machines via key-based SSH authentication:
#' The best approach to automatically launch \R workers on external machines
#' over SSH is to set up key-based SSH authentication.  This will allow you
#' to log into the external machine without have to enter a password.
#'
#' Key-based SSH authentication is taken care of by the SSH client and not \R.
#' To configure this, see the manuals of your SSH client or search the web
#' for "ssh key authentication".
#'
#' @section Reverse SSH tunneling:
#' If SSH is used, which is inferred from `rshcmd[1]`, then the default is
#' to use reverse SSH tunneling (`revtunnel = TRUE`), otherwise not
#' (`revtunnel = FALSE`). Using reverse SSH tunneling, avoids complications
#' from otherwise having to configure port forwarding in firewalls, which
#' often requires static IP address as well as privileges to edit the
#' firewall on your outgoing router, something most users don't have.
#' It also has the advantage of not having to know the internal and / or the
#' public IP address / hostname of the master.
#' Yet another advantage is that there will be no need for a DNS lookup by the
#' worker machines to the master, which may not be configured or is disabled
#' on some systems, e.g. compute clusters.
#'
#' @section Argument `rscript`:
#' If `homogeneous` is FALSE, the `rscript` defaults to `"Rscript"`, i.e. it
#' is assumed that the \command{Rscript} executable is available on the
#' \env{PATH} of the worker.
#' If `homogeneous` is TRUE, the `rscript` defaults to
#' `file.path(R.home("bin"), "Rscript")`, i.e. it is basically assumed that
#' the worker and the caller share the same file system and \R installation.
#'
#' When specified, argument `rscript` should be a character vector with one or
#' more elements.  Any asterisk (`"*"`) will be resolved to the above default
#' `homogeneous`-dependent `Rscript` path.
#' All elements are automatically shell quoted using [base::shQuote()], except
#' those that are of format `<ENVVAR>=<VALUE>`, that is, the ones matching the
#' regular expression '\samp{^[[:alpha:]_][[:alnum:]_]*=.*}'.
#' Another exception is when `rscript` inherits from 'AsIs'.
#' 
#' @section Default value of argument `homogeneous`:
#' The default value of `homogeneous` is TRUE if and only if either
#' of the following is fulfilled:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item `worker` is _localhost_
#'  \item `revtunnel` is FALSE and `master` is _localhost_
#'  \item `worker` is neither an IP number nor a fully qualified domain
#'        name (FQDN).  A hostname is considered to be a FQDN if it contains
#'        one or more periods
#' }
#' In all other cases, `homogeneous` defaults to FALSE.
#' 
#' @section Connection timeout:
#' Argument `connectTimeout` does _not_ work properly on Unix and
#' macOS due to limitation in \R itself.  For more details on this, please see
#' R-devel thread 'BUG?: On Linux setTimeLimit() fails to propagate timeout
#' error when it occurs (works on Windows)' on 2016-10-26
#' (\url{https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2016-October/073309.html}).
#' When used, the timeout will eventually trigger an error, but it won't happen
#' until the socket connection timeout `timeout` itself happens.
#'
#' @section Communication timeout:
#' If there is no communication between the master and a worker within the
#' `timeout` limit, then the corresponding socket connection will be
#' closed automatically.  This will eventually result in an error in code
#' trying to access the connection.
#' This timeout is also what terminates a stray-running parallel cluster-node
#' process.
#'
#' @section Failing to set up local workers:
#' When setting up a cluster of localhost workers, that is, workers running
#' on the same machine as the master \R process, occasionally a connection
#' to a worker ("cluster node") may fail to be set up.
#' When this occurs, an informative error message with troubleshooting
#' suggestions will be produced.
#' The most common reason for such localhost failures is due to port
#' clashes.  Retrying will often resolve the problem.
#'
#' If R stalls when setting up a cluster of local workers, then it might
#' be that you have a virtual private network (VPN) enabled that is
#' configured to prevent you from connecting to `localhost`.  To verify that
#' this is the case, call the following from the terminal:
#'
#' ```sh
#' {local}$ ssh localhost "date"
#' ```
#'
#' This also freezed if the VPN intercepts connections to `localhost`.
#' If this happens, try also:
#'
#' ```sh
#' {local}$ ssh 127.0.0.1 "date"
#' ```
#'
#' In rare cases, `127.0.0.1` might work when `localhost` does not.
#' If the latter works, setting R option:
#'
#' ```r
#' options(parallelly.localhost.hostname = "127.0.0.1")
#' ```
#'
#' should solve it (the default is `"localhost"`).  You can set this
#' automatically when R starts by adding it to your `~/.Rprofile` startup
#' file. Alternatively, set environment variable
#' `R_PARALLELLY_LOCALHOST_HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1` in your `~/.Renviron` file.
#'
#' If using `127.0.0.1` did not work around the problem, check your VPN
#' settings and make sure it allows connections to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
#'
#'
#' @section Failing to set up remote workers:
#' A cluster of remote workers runs \R processes on external machines. These
#' external \R processes are launched over, typically, SSH to the remote
#' machine.  For this to work, each of the remote machines needs to have
#' \R installed, which preferably is of the same version as what is on the
#' main machine.  For this to work, it is required that one can SSH to the
#' remote machines.  Ideally, the SSH connections use authentication based
#' on public-private SSH keys such that the set up of the remote workers can
#' be fully automated (see above).  If `makeClusterPSOCK()` fails to set
#' up one or more remote \R workers, then an informative error message is
#' produced.
#' There are a few reasons for failing to set up remote workers.  If this
#' happens, start by asserting that you can SSH to the remote machine and
#' launch \file{Rscript} by calling something like:
#' \preformatted{
#' {local}$ ssh -l alice remote.server.org
#' {remote}$ Rscript --version
#' R scripting front-end version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)
#' {remote}$ logout
#' {local}$
#' }
#' When you have confirmed the above to work, then confirm that you can achieve
#' the same in a single command-line call;
#' \preformatted{
#' {local}$ ssh -l alice remote.server.org Rscript --version
#' R scripting front-end version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)
#' {local}$
#' }
#' The latter will assert that you have proper startup configuration also for
#' _non-interactive_ shell sessions on the remote machine.
#'
#' If the remote machines are running on MS Windows, make sure to add argument
#' `rscript_sh = "cmd"` when calling `makeClusterPSOCK()`, because the default
#' is `rscript_sh = "sh"`, which assumes that that the remote machines are
#' Unix-like machines.
#' 
#' Another reason for failing to setup remote workers could be that they are
#' running an \R version that is not compatible with the version that your main
#' \R session is running.  For instance, if we run R (>= 3.6.0) locally and the
#' workers run R (< 3.5.0), we will get:
#' `Error in unserialize(node$con) : error reading from connection`.
#' This is because R (>= 3.6.0) uses serialization format version 3 by default
#' whereas R (< 3.5.0) only supports version 2.  We can see the version of the
#' \R workers by adding `rscript_args = c("-e", shQuote("getRversion()"))` when
#' calling `makeClusterPSOCK()`.
#'
